{"id":"keel-6f7","title":"Convert Keel from TypeScript to Go binary","description":"## Goal\nMake Keel usable in any repo (Swift, Android, etc.) by converting from Bun/TypeScript to a standalone Go binary.\n\n## Why\nCurrently requires Bun runtime. Go binary = single executable, works everywhere, matches Beads architecture.\n\n## Approach\n1. Port core types (Decision, DecisionInput)\n2. Port storage (JSONL append, SQLite index)\n3. Port commands (decide, why, supersede, context, search, validate, curate, generate-beads)\n4. Port ID generation (hash-based)\n5. Build/release for multiple platforms\n\n## Reference\n- Look at Beads repo structure for Go CLI patterns\n- Use cobra for CLI (like Beads)\n- Use sqlite3 driver for Go\n\n## Success Criteria\n- `keel decide` works in a Swift project\n- Same JSONL/SQLite format (compatible with TypeScript version)","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-24T13:41:11.612405-04:00","updated_at":"2025-12-24T13:41:11.612405-04:00"}
